## Project motivation

For this project, I was interested in modelling the [New York Cityâ€™s Citi Bike bicycle sharing service](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) data using the [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) library, so that 
I could answer the following questions:

1. What is the general trend of city bike-sharing popularity?
2. What are the yearly and weekly trends?
3. How do holidays influence the number of rents?
4. How did the lockdown due to the COVID pandemic in 2020 affect the number of rents?

## Results

The whole analysis can be found in the `bikesharing_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

The summary and findings can be found at the post available here.
